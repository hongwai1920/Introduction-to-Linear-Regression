## k_nearest_neighbor.py
The file contains the algorithms class KNearestNeighbor

## k nearest neighbor image classifier.ipynb
The notebook contains a detailed introduction and imeplementation of K Nearest Neighbor algorithms from k_nearest_neighbor.py.
We also perform a k-fold cross validation on the hyperparameter k to determine the best k that gives the highest accuracy.
