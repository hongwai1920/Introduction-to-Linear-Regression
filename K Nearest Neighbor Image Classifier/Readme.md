# K Nearest Neighbor Image Classifier
Below is a peek of the CIFAR-10 image dataset. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

## k_nearest_neighbor.py
The file contains the algorithms class KNearestNeighbor

## k nearest neighbor image classifier.ipynb
The notebook contains a detailed introduction and imeplementation of K Nearest Neighbor algorithms from k_nearest_neighbor.py.
We also perform a k-fold cross validation on the hyperparameter k to determine the best k that gives the highest accuracy.
