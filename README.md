# Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains all my implemented machine learning algorithms to understand their theoretical framework. 

## K Nearest Neighbor Image Classifier
We build a k nearest neighbor image classifier from scratch to understand its underlying working mechanisms.
Then we train and test its performance on CIFAR-10 image dataset.

## Linear Regression
This folder contains a detailed and comprehensive introduction to Linear Regression model, including verifying its assumptions.
We use it on Kaggle house prices for prediction.

## SVM Image Classifier
We build SVM Image Classifier from scratch using solely numpy library. 
Then we test its performance on CIFAR-10 image dataset
