# Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains all my implemented machine learning algorithms to understand their theoretical framework. 

## Introduction to Linear Regression.ipynb
This notebook introduces linear regression mathematically and uses Python to check the 5 assumptions using statsmodel.

## k_nearest_neighbor_image_classifier.ipynb
This notebook introduces and implements n-nearest neighbors from scratch and apply it to CIFAR-10 dataset to determine its accuracy.
